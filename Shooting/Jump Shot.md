# Jump shot
A jump shot in basketball is an attempt to score a basket by leaping straight into the air with the elbow of the shooting hand cocked, the ball in hand above the head, and lancing the ball in an arc toward the basket.

The jump shot is the most popular type of shot because it gives the ball momentum to travel further in the air, it's difficult to block by an opposing defender and it has a quicker release compared to a shot done while standing.

### How to shoot a jump shot?
The first step is to prepare your hand for the shot. Your dominant hand lies on the center of the ball and the fingers on your dominant hand are predominantly spread out. Your non-dominant hand lies on the side of the ball, lightly holding it in place. 

The ball is located near your hip and you are slightly crouched to prepare for the jump. Raise your ball to near your forehead with your wrist, elbow, and shoulder locked at ninety degrees. 

While you are swinging the ball up near your forehead, jump, and while you are close or at the apex of your ascent, throw the ball by slowly letting go of the ball with your non-dominant hand, extending your dominant arm, and flicking your wrist on your dominant hand. 

Leave your wrist and hand where it is so you can determine if your shot was good. Your index and middle finger should be pointing at the rim, in a similar look as the arc of the shot. 

Your hand should be pointed above your eyes, roughly at an angle of sixty degrees.

### Drills to train your jump shot
- Normal shots
- 1-2 dribble jump shot
- Turn around mid-range shot

### My jump shot is always missing, what should I do?
Many mistakes can be made while shooting a jump shot. Most beginners don't magically just become great at the jump shot, it is a skill that has to be mastered and you have to practice most days of the week if you want to see improvement. 

If your jump shot still isn't good after weeks of training, it could be that you're doing it wrong. Check to see if any of these apply to you:

- Your jump and release are not coordinated

If you are experiencing that you are predominantly shooting at the end of your jump or you shoot before you jump, you should try working on your jump shot coordination.

- Your arc is too low

If you are experiencing difficulties with getting the ball in the net and most of the shots that you make hit the rim and only then go in, you probably have a low arc. Try releasing the ball at a higher angle and jumping higher.

- Your ball keeps swerving to the side and never goes where you want it

If your ball never seems to go straight, it is probably your non-dominant hand that is affecting the trajectory of the ball. Try softening the feel of your off-hand and be sure to release it before taking your shot.

- Your shot is not one motion

Many beginners have the problem that their shot is separated into two parts, getting the ball to their forehead and only then swinging the ball to the basket. While some very good shooters do this, it is not recommended. Try making your whole shot a single coordinated motion.
