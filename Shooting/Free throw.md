# Free throw
A free throw is a method of attempting to score points, and it's typically awarded as a result of certain fouls committed by the opposing team. 

The free throw consists usually of two shots (sometimes one if a opposing team made foul after the ball went into the ring and scored the points) with the distance of 4.5m (15 feet). Each shot is worth one point (unlike the normal shots which result in two or three points)

The free throw is very common appearance in basketball and in NBA around 70%-80% players make their shots.

## How to do a free throw
***Preparation:***
The first step is to prepare yourself, stand behind free-throw line, which is 4.5m away from the basket. Position your feet-shoulder apart, with your shooting side foot slightly ahead of your non-shooting foot.
Also, align your body so that your shooting-side shoulder is pointing towards the basket.

***Grip and ball placement:*** 
Hold the basketball with your shooting hand under the ball and your non-shooting hand on the side of the ball for balance and support.
Your shooting hand should be under the ball, with your fingers spread comfortably and your shooting hand's wrist bent back slightly.

***Shooting motion***
Release the ball at the peak of your jump or slightly before. Your shooting hand and fingers should point toward the basket as you release the ball, also as you progress your free throw shots try to add some backspin to ball.
Important: Your shooting hand should be under the ball, with your fingers spread comfortably and your shooting hand's wrist bent back slightly. 

***Important***
You must feel comfortable while you shoot the shot, if you don't feel comfortable you probably aren't doing something right which could result in an injury and incorrect shooting technique.
