## Pull-up jump shot
Pull-up jump shot is a basketball move in which a player dribble drives, stops and shoots a jump shot.
 This shot is arguably one of the best and hardest shots to achieve in basketball, because it allows you to virtually get your shot off at anytime or place on the court.
 
 
*****How to do a pull-up jump shot*****
The first step is to master ''*Two Motion shot*"* or more known as  "*Traditional shot"*, the shot where you release the ball at the top of your jump. Reason behind mastering traditional shot is that it will allow you to get that needed balance for your shot. For example your shot is probably going to happen in the midrange or off of some type of explosive move where your defender thinks you are going to drive to the basket.

Force absorption - you need to absorb force effectively so you can be more balanced on your shot. This will not only help you on your shooting but in every area of basketball as well

Alignment- This changes depending on which side of the floor you are on but, it is important to know that whether you know it or not most shooters like to align there elbow, hips, and shooting shoulder directly towards the basket.

I can't stress this enough but you need a lot of practice, and also a great physical endurance, because pull-up shots take a lot of effort and if you don't have great condition you can get tired very quick. Lot of people say that doing pull-up jump shots are much harder to do in real game than doing it by themselves alone. The reason behind this is when you are practicing alone you don't know where the defender position is, and this shot has so many variances that can change the shot. From the speed in which your dribbling to when and where your defender contests.
