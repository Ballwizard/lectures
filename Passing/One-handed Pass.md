The one-handed pass is a type of pass in which motion starts from the hip and the force to throw the ball is generated by one arm predominantly. One-handed passes are useful for passing the ball around an enemy player.

### How to do a one-handed pass? 
Start with the ball planted on either the right side or the left side of your hip, with one palm behind the ball and the other on the side to support in holding the ball. The next and final step is to throw the ball using your hand that

Leave your hands for a moment when you throw the ball. Your fingers should be rotated behind the ball and turned downwards. The ball should be spinning toward you while in the air.

If the ball is being thrown towards a player, try to aim so that the ball also lands near their chest.
