# One-handed Pass
The one-handed pass is a type of pass in which motion starts from the chest. Chest passes are probably the most accurate and most powerful types of passes in basketball. 

While many beginners exclusively use this type of pass (especially in lower competition levels), the chest pass isn't the best pass for all cases.

### How to do a chest pass?
We are going to group normal layups into two broad categories, those which are done:

 - From a standing position (using no dribbles)
 - From a dribble
 - 
Start with the ball planted on or near your chest, with both of your arms near the sides of the ball. The next and final step is to simply throw the ball in your desired direction. 

Leave your hands for a moment when you throw the ball. Your fingers should be rotated behind the ball and turned downwards. The ball should be spinning toward you while in the air.

If the ball is being thrown towards a player, try to aim so that the ball also lands near their chest.
