# Bounce pass
The bounce pass is a type of pass in which the ball bounces off of the floor. Bounce passes one of basketball's easiest, yet complex passes. 

The bounce pass can be sometimes very hard to time properly and can lead to many lost possessions.

### How to do a bounce pass?

Start with the ball planted on or near your chest, with both of your arms near the sides of the ball. The next and final step is to simply throw the ball in your desired direction. 

Leave your hands for a moment when you throw the ball. Your fingers should be rotated behind the ball and turned downwards. The ball should be spinning toward you while in the air.

If the ball is being thrown towards a player, try to aim so that the ball also lands near their chest.
