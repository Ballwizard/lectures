A floater in basketball is a two-point shot attempt made by leaping from below, laying the ball up near the basket, and using one hand to bounce it off the backboard and into the basket or directly into the basket by throwing it in the air.

The layup is the easiest form of scoring and an open layup shouldn't be missed. It is a finishing move used in every level of competitive basketball.

### How to do a layup?
We are going to group normal layups into two broad categories, those which are done:

 - From a standing position (using no dribbles)
 - From a dribble

If you have just received the ball and you haven't done any dribbles, then you have only two steps to get to the basket. The first thing you need to decide is which side of the basket are you currently on. 

If the basket is on your left, then you should probably do a right-handed layup. From your starting position take a step with your right foot, holding the ball close to your body and on the right side of your body. Take another step, this time with your left foot. Then explode off of your left foot and bring your right knee up. Raise the ball above your head and throw the ball off of the backboard, aiming for the upper right corner of the white rectangle located on most backboards. 

If the basket is on your right, then the logical option is to do a left-handed layup. The steps will be the same, just with a different starting foot. This time it will be with the left foot first then comes the right foot from which you jump from and shoot the ball.

On the other hand, if you are in a position where you are considerably away from the basket, dribble the ball, effectively giving you three steps for a layup. 
The first step needs to be done just after the ball has landed on the floor. If you are on the right side, this time the first foot will be your left foot, then your right, and then finally your left foot from which you explode.
If you are on the left side, start with your right foot, then your left, and then your right.

### When should you do a layup?
A layup is the most used finishing move in basketball. The layup should be done when you are near the basket and the opposing defenders are not near the basket. If you are sure that you can get to the basket and that you won't get blocked by an opposing defender, the layup is probably the best choice you have.
