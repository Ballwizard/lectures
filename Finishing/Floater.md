# Floaters

A floater in basketball is a finesse shot that involves a player softly releasing the ball into the basket while moving towards it. It is a crafty and effective scoring technique, especially when faced with taller defenders or when driving into the key.

The floater is a valuable skill for guards and small forwards, providing them with an alternative scoring option when a direct layup is challenging. While not as straightforward as a layup, the floater adds versatility to a player's offensive repertoire.

### How to Execute a Floater?

Floaters can be executed in various situations, and players often resort to them when a direct path to the basket is hindered. Here are two common scenarios:

-   **Penetration without Dribbling:** If you find yourself in a position to take a shot without dribbling, ensure you have good control of the ball. As you approach the basket, gauge the distance and height of the defenders. When you are near the free-throw line or slightly closer, softly release the ball with a one-handed shot, aiming for a high, arching trajectory. This allows the ball to float over outstretched defenders and into the basket.
    
-   **Penetration with Dribbling:** When dribbling towards the basket, use the dribbles to create separation from defenders. As you near the paint area, execute a quick, controlled dribble followed by a swift, one-handed release of the ball. The key is to release the floater before the shot-blocking defenders can reach the peak of their jump.
    

### When to Use a Floater?

Knowing when to unleash a floater is crucial for maximizing its effectiveness. Floaters are particularly useful when you are in the key, and taller defenders are closing in. The shot's trajectory allows you to avoid shot-blocking attempts, making it an ideal choice when a layup is not feasible.

### Exercises to Develop Floater Skills

To hone your floater skills, consider incorporating the following exercises into your training regimen:

-   **Floaters from Different Angles:** Practice floaters from various positions on the court, simulating game scenarios where you might need to shoot over defenders from different angles.
    
-   **Defender Simulation:** Have a training partner or coach mimic defensive pressure as you practice floaters. This helps simulate in-game conditions and improves your ability to read and react to defenders.
