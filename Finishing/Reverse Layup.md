# Underhand layup

An underhand layup is a form of layup where the player raises the ball from a low point to a high point, spinning the ball by flicking it to the hoop. The underhand layup is an alternative to the overhand layup where instead of always having your ball above, it goes from under to above. 

### How to do a layup?

The underhand layup requires gentleness and an understanding of ball physics. Unlike the regular overhand layup, the underhand layup requires much more precision, but with that precision comes (in most cases) better results. 

The motion of the underhand layup starts with the ball in front of you, in a low position. You are holding it with only one hand on the bottom of the ball. Now, take a step with your right foot if you are on the right side of the basket and likewise on the left side. 

Then take another step. Explode from your foot with the ball in front of you. Once you are close to the apex of your rise (while you're still rising), release the ball by flicking your wrist, and rolling the ball towards the basket. 


### When should you do an underhand layup?

The underhand layup is often used to get many foul calls. If you see that you have an aggressive defender chasing you, it is in most cases better to use an underhand layup to get your defender to initiate contact with your arm, drawing a foul.

### Drills to train to make layups

While there aren't any specific drills to train making underhand layups, we suggest just making as many attempts as you can. Start near the basket, then start going further away, utilizing more dribbles.
