# Reverse Layup

A reverse layup is a form of layup where the player throws the ball from the opposite side of the hoop. Imagine that you are attacking the basket on the right side, using a reverse layup the ball will enter the basket from the left side instead of the right side. To consistantly make reverse layups you will probably need to train your vertical leap in order to make it in the air from one side of the basket to the other.

### How to do a reverse layup?

The reverse layup starts with the player holding the ball on one side of the basket. Dribble then take a step, if you're sure that you can jump from that position and end up on the other side of the basket, then jump. If not, take another step and dribble until you are close enough.

Whilst in the air, place your hand that is on the side of the basket under the ball. Extend your arm as much as possible


### When should you do an underhand layup?

The underhand layup is often used to get many foul calls. If you see that you have an aggressive defender chasing you, it is in most cases better to use an underhand layup to get your defender to initiate contact with your arm, drawing a foul.

### Drills to train to make layups

While there aren't any specific drills to train making underhand layups, we suggest just making as many attempts as you can. Start near the basket, then start going further away, utilizing more dribbles.
