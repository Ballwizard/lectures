# Criss-cross

The criss-cross is a drill that teaches players coordination, spatial coordination, how to aim, and how time passes.

### How to do the criss-cross drill

Start by placing two cones on either side of the court, about 15 feet away from the basket. One player starts with the ball, and passes it to the other player on the opposite side of the court. 

The player who receives the ball then takes a shot from the cone on their side of the court. After the shot is taken, the other player grabs the rebound and passes the ball back to the shooter. The shooter then takes a shot from the cone on the opposite side of the court. 

This pattern continues, with each player taking turns shooting from each cone. The goal of the drill is to make as many shots as possible in a set amount of time, such as one minute. You can also increase the difficulty by adding a defender to the drill, who can try to block shots or steal the ball. This drill is great for improving shooting accuracy, as well as practicing passing, rebounding, and teamwork. Have fun!

### Variants

- Criss-cross with a dribble

The name speaks for itself, each player is permitted to do a dribble once they have the ball instead of just doing two steps.

- Two on one criss-cross

The two-on-one no-dribble variant is a variant where once a player has made the layup, his duty is to sprint back and play defense versus the two players who didn't do the layup. This variant is often played with no dribbles or only one dribble per person which makes it harder for the two players to score.
