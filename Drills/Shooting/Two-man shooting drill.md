# Two-sprint

The two-sprint drill incorporates running, rebounding, passing and shooting into one drill. The two-sprint mainly focuses on working on the player's ability to shoot while being more and more tired.

### How to do the two-sprint drill

Start by placing two cones on either side of the court, about 15 feet away from the basket. One player starts with the ball and passes it to the other player on the opposite side of the court. 

The player who receives the ball then takes a shot from the cone on their side of the court. After the shot is taken, the other player grabs the rebound and passes the ball back to the shooter. The shooter then takes a shot from the cone on the opposite side of the court.  This pattern continues, with each player taking turns shooting from each cone. 

The goal of the drill is to make as many shots as possible in a set amount of time, such as one minute. You can also increase the difficulty by adding a defender to the drill, who can try to block shots or steal the ball. This drill is great for improving shooting accuracy, as well as practising passing, rebounding, and teamwork.
