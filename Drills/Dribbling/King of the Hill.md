# King of the Hill

The King of the Hill is a dribbling drill in which multiple players compete to stay inside the selected area while dribbling the ball the whole time.

### How to do the  drill
The criss-cross is (oftenly) done with three to five people. In this example, it will be demonstrated with three people. The three people are all placed in the line behind the basket. Two of the people are placed on on the sides and the one with the ball is in the middle.

Once the whistle is blown, the wing players should start moving in a diagonal, at which point the middle player should pass the ball to one of them. It is important to note that the basic criss-cross doesn't permit any dribbles, so be careful when using your two steps. Once the middle player has made a pass to a wing player, he should start sprinting behind the person he gave the pass. 

Once the wing (now center) player has the ball, he should take two steps and pass the ball to the other wing player, again going behind him. This process repeats until a person is near the basket, at which point the player simply does a layup and the drill is over. 

An additional component can be added to the drill is instead of finishing the drill when a player scores, it continues by one of the players which didn't score grabbing a rebound (if the player scores, the rebounder just picks up the ball). The player who scored continues running to the opposite wing of the court as he scored the ball in, while the other player that didn't score sprints to the opposite wing of the court as the player who scored. The rebounder passes the ball and the same drill repeats.

This can be done for however many iterations needed.

### Variants

- Criss-cross with a dribble

The name speaks for itself, each player is permitted to do a dribble once they have the ball instead of just doing two steps.

- Two on one criss-cross

The two on one no dribble variant is a variant where once a player has made the layup, his duty is to sprint back and play defence versus the two players that didn't do the layup. This variant is often played with no dribbles or only one dribble per person which makes it harder for the two players to score.
