# King of the Hill

The King of the Hill is a dribbling drill in which multiple players compete to stay inside the selected area while dribbling the ball the whole time.

### How to do the King of the Hill drill
The King of the Hill drill is done with a minimum of two people.

First, an area needs to be selected for the scope of the drill, take the rectangular-shaped area underneath the basket for an example. Players stand inside and once the whistle is blown, they immediately start dribbling and they should not stop. If a player stops dribbling, they exit the area and are disqualified. 

The objective of the drill is to knock out other players by grabbing, punching, or throwing their ball out of the play area. Once a players ball has exited out of the play area, they are disqualified.

If no action is happening and all of the players in the contention aren't doing anything, shrink the play area and continue playing.

This continues up until one person is left in the area and they are crowned as the "King of the Hill".
