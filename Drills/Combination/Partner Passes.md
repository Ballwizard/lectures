### How to do the Russian criss-cross drill

The Russian criss-cross drill needs to be done with at least three pairs of three players. Two pairs are standing on one side of the baseline, one is standing on the opposite baseline. The two pairs have three balls, one for the first pair that starts the drill and two for the pair behind (the wing players have them). The pair on the other side of the court also has two balls.

The three players of the pairs are spread out on the baseline (one in the middle and two on the wings).

The first part of the drill is the same as the normal criss-cross. It starts with two regular criss-cross passes. Once the two passes have been done, the two players without the ball sprint to the players that are holding the ball which will pass them the ball. After getting the ball, the players shoot as soon as they can. The player with the ball continues dribbling to the basket to make a layup.

Once the player with the ball has made the layup, the middle player of the pair that passed the balls grabs the ball and does the same thing.

The drill can be repeated as many times as needed.
