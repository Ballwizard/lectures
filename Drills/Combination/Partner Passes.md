# Partner Passes

Partner passes is a combination drill which improves passing, dribbling, finishing, multitasking and court-awareness. It is a simple drill that can be done in any skill level of basketball and is a good way to warm up the team for a match.

### How to do the Partner passes drill

Partner passes needs to be done with at least 2 people. Both players stand on opposite sides of the key. Once the whistle is blown, they both run forward while passing the ball up the court.

When one of the two players crosses one half of the court, that person starts dribbling while the other one sprints diagonally until they reach the three point line. Then they quickly change direction and sprint towards the basket. The player that has been dribbling passes the ball to him as soon as he starts running toward the basket. The pass can be of any variant.
