The between the legs dribble is used for a quick change of direction (and speed) to startle defenders and advance up the court. The move is frequently used in all skill ranges of competitive basketball.
### How to do a between the legs dribble?
First and foremost, we have to nail the actual movement of the ball before we can do the dribble. Stand with your body in a so called "scissor stance" with one of your legs behind the other but spread apart.

Now, put the ball on the ground and start rolling the ball through your legs, pushing the ball with each hand as it passes through your legs. Do this for about five minutes while keeping your head up, not looking at the ball.

After you've mastered that, pick up the ball and do the same thing but in air. Holing the ball with one hand, pass it through your legs (whilst still in the air) and grab it with your other hand and raising it to a little above your hip. To make it more harder, after you've passed the ball to the other side, take a step and repeat, now with your other leg forward. Keep your head up as much as you can.

We're ready to do the actual dribble. With the same scissor stance as we did in the previous parts, instead of grabbing the ball on the other side, bounce it near the middle of your legs (it doesn't have to be precisely between) and then catch it with your other hand. Repeat the motion until your comfortable (don't forget to have your head in the air).
