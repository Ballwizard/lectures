The between the legs dribble is used for a quick change of direction (and speed) to startle defenders and advance up the court. The move is frequently used in all skill ranges of competitive basketball.
### How to do a between the legs dribble?
First and foremost, we have to nail the actual movement of the ball before we can do the dribble. Stand with your body in a so called "scissor stance" with one of your legs behind the other but spread apart.

Now, put the ball on the ground and start rolling the ball through your legs, pushing the ball with each hand as it passes through your legs. Do this for about five minutes while exclusively looking up.
