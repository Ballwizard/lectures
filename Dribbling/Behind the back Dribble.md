The behind the back dribble is used for a hard to stop, safe and unpredictable change in direction and/or speed. The move is frequently used in all skill ranges of competitive basketball.

### How to do a behind the back dribble?
Before we try to do any sort of motion, we need to get in the right stance. Straighten your back, enter a half-squat stance, and slightly lean back. 

To prepare for the actual motion, we aren't going to do any dribbles. With one of your hands holding the ball bring your ball low and bring it to your other hand behind your back. Do it back and forward, with both of your hands as the starting ones. Repeat the motion and do it faster and faster. 

Once you've become comfortable with that, instead of simply bringing the ball to your other side, do a dribble in between. When starting, try bringing your hand more back so you can do the dribble forward (aimed at your other side). 

It is important that you aren't dribbling the ball side-to-side, as when you actually do this move in-game, you will have to lose momentum doing the dribble. The goal is to wrap your hand behind your back while minimizing your space taken up while doing the dribble. You want to be able to do the dribble with as little area as possible as it will make your dribble faster and less predictable.
