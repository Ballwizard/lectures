The behind the back dribble is used for a hard to stop 
### How to do a between the legs dribble?
First and foremost, we have to nail the actual movement of the ball before we can do the dribble. Stand with your body in a so called "scissor stance" with one of your legs behind the other but spread apart.

Now, put the ball on the ground and start rolling the ball through your legs, pushing the ball with each hand as it passes through your legs. Do this for about five minutes while keeping your head up, not looking at the ball.

After you've mastered that, pick up the ball and do the same thing but in air. Holing the ball with one hand, pass it through your legs (whilst still in the air) and grab it with your other hand and raising it to a little above your hip. To make it more harder, after you've passed the ball to the other side, take a step and repeat, now with your other leg forward. Keep your head up as much as you can.

We're ready to do the actual dribble. With the same scissor stance as we did in the previous parts, instead of grabbing the ball on the other side, bounce it near the middle of your legs (it doesn't have to be precisely between) and then catch it with your other hand. Repeat the motion until your comfortable (don't forget to have your head in the air).

To actually make the movement useful, we have to know how to do it while moving and dribbling. Start by dribbling forward and then placing your feet in a scissor stance while moving and doing the exact same thing, but now we are not going to bounce to the other side while leaning sligthly forward. After you've gotten the ball to the other side of your legs, dribble and continue moving. When you can do that consistently you've mastered the between the legs dribble.
